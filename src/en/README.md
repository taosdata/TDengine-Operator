This document is for [TDengine] database deployment on [Kubernetes(k8s)][K8s]. All the things we do is for who love [TDengine] and want to take it to k8s. We are hosting the documentation on [taosdata/TDengine-Operator](https://github.com/taosdata/TDengine-Operator). Anyone want to help improve the documentations could edit the markdown files.

If you encounter problems following the operations, you can always add our official WeChat "tdengine" to join our chat group to get help from us and other TDengine database users.
